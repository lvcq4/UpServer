# 🚀 UpServer  

Keep your FiveM server up to date with ease! **UpServer** automates the update process for your server artifacts, ensuring that your server runs the latest version without manual intervention.  

## 🔧 Features (Coming Soon!)  

Here’s what you can expect in the first release:  
- **Automatic Artifact Updates**:  
  - Fetch the latest recommended or optional FiveM server artifacts directly.  
  - Apply updates seamlessly without affecting your existing configurations.  
- **Backup Before Update**:  
  - Automatically create backups of your current server setup before applying updates.  
- **Scheduled Updates**:  
  - Set a schedule for updates to run at convenient times, minimizing downtime during peak hours.  
- **Notification System**:  
  - Get notified via Discord or server logs about the status of your updates (e.g., successful, failed).  
- **Compatibility Check**:  
  - Ensure that updates are compatible with your current server configuration before applying them.  

## 🚧 Planned Features for Future Versions  
- **Framework Compatibility**:  
  - Auto-adjust server resources for popular frameworks like ESX, QBCore, and more.  
- **Database Backup**:  
  - Optionally back up your database during the update process to prevent data loss.

## 🛠️ How It Works  
1. **UpServer** connects to the FiveM artifact repository.  
2. It checks for new updates and compares them with your current server version.  
3. If an update is available, it creates a backup of your server files.  
4. The latest artifacts are downloaded and applied to your server.  
5. Optionally, you'll receive a summary report of the update.
